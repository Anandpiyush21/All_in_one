# Project: Development of an automated ML-based tool for classification problems

Aim: To develop a comprehensive python script that will run (binary or multi-class) classification
problems on any given input data matrix

## Project Structure

Ensure that the following files are in the same folder:

- `dataset.csv` (Your dataset in the prescribed form)

- `main.py`

- `normalization.py`

    I've given 6 Options here : 
    1. StandardScaler
    2. MinMaxScaler
    3. RobustScaler
    4. Normalizer
    5. MaxAbsScaler
    6. PowerTransformer

- `feature_selection.py`

    I've given 8 Options here :
    1. SelectKBest (ANOVA)
    2. RFE (Recursive Feature Elimination)
    3. Variance Threshold
    4. Mutual Information
    5. F-statistic (f_classif)
    6. Principal Component Analysis (PCA)
    7. Recursive Feature Addition (RFA)
    8. L1-based feature selection (LASSO)

- `cross_val.py`

    I've given 6 Options here :
    1. K-Fold Cross-Validation
    2. Stratified K-Fold Cross-Validation
    3. Repeated K-Fold Cross-Validation  
    4. Group K-Fold Cross-Validation     
    5. Time Series Split Cross-Validation
    6. Shuffle Split Cross-Validation

- `models.py`

    I've given 8 Options here :
    1. Random Forest
    2. K-Nearest Neighbors
    3. Support Vector Machine
    4. Logistic Regression
    5. Naive Bayes
    6. Gradient Boosting
    7. Decision Tree
    8. Neural Network


# Execution

Open a command prompt and navigate to the project folder.

Execute the following command to run the program:

python main.py

Output

Upon execution, the program will generate:

results.pdf: Contains accuracy scores,and all performance metrics
plots.pdf: Includes visual representations of the results.
